PCB order from https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/ZX_Spectrum_clone_based_at_STM32F401_BlackPill_36e0f1bb.html but had 2 errors:
1) at SD card (instead 1st pin need to be 3th pin)
2) green wire between A2 pin from STM32F4xx board to pin no. 6 (IN2) of 74VHC244 chip.

Also it need SD card with max. 8Gb FAT32 4096b (4kb)
