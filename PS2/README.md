Original version of Andrey Pastuhkov (info, schematic, hex files) can be found in description of the video from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xHpkOBTd6Y 
I tested hex file v0.92 as you can find in the video (download from https://drive.google.com/file/d/17b2iGjg2wVHHNKI5y9oQqBArEMC8mSdz/view )
That version (same as previous version) save the iun file as TAP as original "speed".

I ordered the PCB using info from https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/ZX_Spectrum_clone_based_at_STM32F401_with_VGA_output_and_PS_2_keyboard_input_ab6bfdd9.html
